      Will talk to Benjamin on <2019-02-05 Tue>. Tentative plan for next weeks follows.
*** DONE [3/3] week 3: Figure out the parser despite setbacks
    CLOSED: [2019-02-13 Wed 12:06]
***** DONE Figure out how to create custom architectures
      CLOSED: [2019-02-05 Tue 18:43]
      Currently there's no way to do that: the architectures are built into the
      compiler, and I don't have the Xilinx compiler's source code.

      I can hopefully use XilinxStreamSwitch with a bit of poking at the Verilog
      wrapper module.
***** NOPE Create a ~packet_mod~-enabled architecture
      Equivalent to SimpleSumeSwitch but with packet_mod for the deparser.
      Rejected because not possible; will use ~XilinxStreamSwitch~.
***** DONE update [[*P4 spec compatibility (or lack thereof)]]
      CLOSED: [2019-02-13 Wed 12:06]
      make it actually correspond to reality:
       - Xilinx is working on a new compiler, old one sucks and will continue
         sucking, new one doesn't have an officially released timeline, so we're
         stuck with the one that sucks
       - wanted to use a custom architecture but that's baked into the compiler
         => nope
       - can use ~XilinxStreamSwitch~, will need to modify wrapper thingy in some
         unknown way (no docs)

        NetFPGA was acting up (couldn't DMA to it, didn't see the PCI device). 
        Fixed by:
         1. Pushing the reset button. (It's one of the 3 buttons, just push all 3 :D)
         2. Powering off the host machine, including pulling out the power cable.
         3. Rebooting the host machine (without power off).
        Afterwards, it flashed successfully.

        Test fails, unsure why. Don't care enough.

    CLOSED: [2019-02-07 Thu 10:18]
Progress report until now:

 - Background research:
   - read NetFPGA and Xilinx compiler docs, got familiar with the workflow
   - got more familiar with the details of SCION: got a VM from SCIONLab, sniffed
     packets, re-read parts of the SCION book with P4 and NetFPGA in mind
   - Read Seyedali's documentation (scion-netfpga project)
   - background reading on FPGAs: building intuition; workflow; timing issues; etc.
     (Needed because while P4 abstracts away the logic, it does not automate all
     FPGA design tasks.)
 - Planning ahead: thought about project structure, modularity, portability.
   (I will support both the P4 software switch and NetFPGA, to ease testing and
   to force this project to be easily portable to other HW platforms.)
 - Made progress on writing the SCION packet parser.
 - Discovered a major problem and after many attempts found a workaround that might
   actually work:

   TL;DR: The NetFPGA can't deal with variable length headers, such as the SCION
   path. Get around it by sacrificing FPGA area (we have plenty) and using a
   non-standard P4 extension.

   Longer version:

   The NetFPGA's P4 compiler does not support doing anything with
   variable-length headers (not even skipping them).
   (The background info gained by talking to NetFPGA people is that Xilinx is
   not fixing the old compiler, but writing a new one. I cannot rely on the new
   compiler being released in time, hence the workaround.)

   How I am planning to solve this:

   1. Assume a max path length K, let's say K = 30. Use the C preprocessor to
      "unroll" the parsing: create K separate parser states that parse a 1-hop
      segment, a 2-hop segment, etc (compile-time known value, so that works).
      The NetFPGA has plenty of space.
   2. While the SCION path can be arbitrarily long, my BR only needs to look at
      either 1 or 2 hops. Therefore I can skip the rest and only use O(1) buffer
      space per state, not O(K). Thereby I can avoid an O(K^2) blowup and fit a
      bigger K. (The NetFPGA is big, but not infinite).
   3. Standard P4 does not allow me to emit headers I haven't parsed. Therefore
      I will use the experimental `packet_mod` feature to avoid losing the
      skipped parts.
   4. Using `packet_mod` requires deviating from the "usual" NetFPGA Verilog
      wrappers, but my initial research suggests that this should be doable in
      less than 1 day of work. Therefore, worth trying.
   5. Bonus: `packet_mod` should help with parser and deparser performance.
   6. Backup plan if `packet_mod` turns out to be too experimental to work: Live
      with the O(K^2) blowup until the new compiler comes out. Make it easy to
      switch to it (yay portability).

Next steps:

Still waiting for the license. Can't confirm that `packet_mod` works as expected
until then.
Meanwhile, writing the parser assuming one of {fully compliant P4 compiler, the
`packet_mod` feature}. If it turns out I have neither of those, it will be <2
extra days of work to make it work without them with the O(K^2) blowup.
*** DONE progress report <2019-02-20 Wed>
    CLOSED: [2019-03-04 Mon 15:40]
This is a summary of what happened since my last progress report.

The main news is that my modified design is happily running on the physical
hardware.

 * Working with the real hardware:
   - Discovered, reported, and overcame several problems with the upstream
     P4-NetFPGA repo's workflow.
   - Tested, understood, adapted, and documented the complete (surprisingly
     complicated!) process of making P4 run on the NetFPGA.
   - Overcame issues with the NetFPGA and managed to flash and test it
     successfully.
 * `XilinxStreamSwitch`: "Experimental" architecture that helps with variable
   length parsing + improves performance
   - Adapted the hardware design to make it possible to use `XilinxStreamSwitch`
     on the NetFPGA.
   - Tested `XilinxStreamSwitch` in real life and verified the basic
     functionality.
 * Improved project structure to make this repo easy to work with (unlike the
   upstream P4-NetFPGA repository).
 * Added basic testing infrastructure: behavioural simulation + real HW.
*** NEXT progress report<2019-03-06 Wed> 
This is a summary of what happened since my last progress report.

I was travelling, so this time it is somewhat shorter, but the tasks I completed
were important.

 1. Learned a lot about the Xilinx Vivado toolchain
 2. Completely rewrote the build process: Now it is simplified and fully automated, instead of being a weird combination of Makefiles and clicking in Vivado IDE
 3. Fixed a major "stale state is tainting the build" problem (inherited from the NetFPGA template)
 5. Learned some more Verilog basics and fixed bugs in NetFPGA Verilog wrappers
 6. Probably really made XilinxStreamSwitch/packet_mod work (point 3's problem had been hiding an issue with it)

* Questions about FPGAs
*** DONE VHDL vs Verilog: what's the relationship?
    CLOSED: [2019-01-23 Wed 11:05]
    Both are hardware description languages. VHDL smells a little more like Ada
    and Verilog smells a little more like C. As far as I can tell, Verilog is
    slightly more popular in FPGA circles. Most Xilinx tooling will be using
    Verilog.

    You can combine modules written in either as long as you know what the
    interfaces are. A bit like you can link things written in different
    languages in software too.
*** DONE How do you do modular design? Literally "LEGO submodules"?
    CLOSED: [2019-01-23 Wed 11:05]
    Generally, you will want a bus like AMBA or Axi and your modules will talk
    to each other on the bus using well-defined protocols.
*** DONE What does IP stand for in FPGA context?
    CLOSED: [2019-01-20 Sun 11:42]
    "intelectual property core" ==> something that you buy from someone else and
    integrate in your design.

    Can be pronounced "module" or even "chip".

    Blocks may be more or less independent. You could add e.g. a microblaze cpu
    to your design. It will have its own clock domains and talk to other modules
    using memory. Or you might have something like AES which operates in your
    data path.
*** TODO Gimme a nice paper about implementing something on an FPGA in a nice way.
    So that I can do my learning by example thing.
*** TODO What's this thing about 8 bytes? How general is it?
*** DONE How do I find out if it's optimal?
    CLOSED: [2019-01-23 Wed 11:08]
    This P4 stuff will compile into something that will light up different parts
    of the FPGA at different times. I want to:
      - look at it
      - figure out whether it could be parallelising some more
      - tell it to do better (maybe :D)

    Supposedly the Vivado tools help with that. I should revisit this once I get
    the license crap to work.

* Notes to self
*** about NetFPGA
***** Annotations:
       apparently there is a pile of @Xilinx_whatever annotations which look
       like they affect how the things are laid out on the FPGA
       ==> documented in P4-SDNet
***** Architecture:
      #+BEGIN_SRC p4_16
      SimpleSumeSwitch(
          TopParser(),
          TopPipe(),
          TopDeparser()
      ) main;
      #+END_SRC
***** Registers:
      Accessing registers doesn't exist :D
      They have an extern which is one function where an argument says whether
      it's a read or a write, and there is just one register:
      #+begin_src p4_16
      const_reg_rw(
          index,
          value_to_be_written, // probably bit<
          r_or_w,  // bit<8>
          value_will_be_read_into_here
      );
      #+end_src
      Actually this is a bit weird and confusing.
***** Testing things
      You generate pcap files with input packets and expected
      output packets. (Not sure if the expected packets are an exact match or
      what.)

      The neat thing about that: there's a pcap2axi thing, so the packets are
      replayed from memory. Therefore...
***** Performace testing
      Just make a big pcap file :D ^^
***** DONE Turning source code into bits in the FPGA
      CLOSED: [2019-02-18 Mon 22:05] SCHEDULED: <2019-02-14 Thu>: complete this
       1. ~p4c-sdnet~ converts P4 into the SDNet language, which is a Xilinx
          thing that looks a little like C++. Check out .sdnet files.
          Makefile target: ~sdnet~
          *Important thing to note: the compiler will not generate control ports
          unless there's at least one table that's actually used in the design.
          With the current flags, that means that the compilation will fail
          without tables.*
       2. ~sdnet~ compiles the .sdnet file into a module/IP core that then
          goes into Vivado. I can pick the bus type as a compiler flag (sample
          project makefile has Axi).
          Makefile target: ~module~ (doesn't exist yet, TODO)
          From now on it's the usual FPGA workflow.
       3. check with Vivado sim: generate input and output packets and tuples
          and compare.
          Tuples are the ~switch_meta_t~ struct.
          Target: ~sim~
       4. Create Vivado project: Target: ~project~
       5. Synth. Target: ~synth~

***** portability
       - runs on SDNet and v1model and the SCION code doesn't need to change to add a new arch
       - can benefit from features present only on some archs, but doesn't need much rewriting because of ~lib/compat~ and because modularity
***** attention to detail
       - by only passing the parameters I really need instead of the whole metadata or headers struct, I both enforce modularity *and* give the compiler more information about the code so that it can optimise better. TODO would be neat to have an example.
*** Challenges
***** P4 spec compatibility (or lack thereof)
Unfortunately, the SDNet P4 compiler implements only a subset of P4, which has
created unexpected challenges when implementing SCION.
The biggest issue [HOPEFULLY :D] was that at the time of writing, with P4-SDNet
the parser cannot work with any variable-length data: this includes not only
=varbit<n>= types, but also header unions, and -- most importantly -- header
stacks.
Furthermore, it is unable to even skip over variable-length parts of the packet.
Simply put, all packet offsets must be compile-time constants.
This poses a problem for SCION: the path in the packet is variable length (it
can contain any number of hops).[fn:varlen]
Therefore, the parser cannot easily deal with the path in the SCION
packet.[fn:cantparse]

To get around this problem, we employed the following steps:

First of all, we opted to design the parser so that it parses only the actually
needed data: while the path can be arbitrarily long, any single BR only needs to
process $O(1)$ hop fields (usually one, or two in case of a shortcut path).
This not only makes it possible to compile for the NetFPGA, but also improves
performance on other targets.

Next, we needed to solve the problem of emitting headers we have skipped:
using only the standard features
of P4, it is impossible to deparse parts of the header which have not been
parsed. (The payload is copied without being parsed, but the payload is defined
as anything *after* the last thing we parsed -- so if we skip parsing something
in the header, it is lost and we are unable to emit it on the output interface.)

The solution on the NetFPGA is to use the non-standard ~packet_mod~ feature of
P4-SDNet, as this (unlike the standard deparsers) allows to modify the existing
header instead of creating it anew, thereby allowing me to not lose the skipped
parts of the header.

Using the ~packet_mod~ feature is not straightforward, either: we needed to
switch to the ~XilinxStreamSwitch~ architecture, as this feature is not
available in the ~SimpleSumeSwitch~ architecture that is the default on the
NetFPGA.
This required modifying the Verilog wrappers provided by the NetFPGA developers.

Obviously, using a non-standard SDNet-only feature means that with this
approach, the program would not compile on a standard P4 compiler.
However, standard P4 compilers (unlike the P4-SDNet compiler) tend to implement
parsing variable-length headers.
Therefore, we are able to emulate ~packet_mod~ for standard compilers by adding
an extra struct to keep track of the "skipped" parts of the headers, and instead
of skipping them, we parse them into the (variable-length) fields of this extra
struct.

We can use the C preprocessor to hide this difference, thereby keeping our
code portable while being able to use ~packet_mod~ where available.
This not only allows us to parse the variable-length SCION packet on the
currently incomplete P4-SDNet compiler, but also allows us to harness the
performance benefits of the ~packet_mod~ feature on any target where it is
available.

To make this approach work, the last step is to turn all packet offsets,
including the ones used only for skipping, into compile-time constants.
Fortunately, SCION hop fields are constant length.
Therefore, if we assume a maximum path length $K$, let's say $K = 50$, there are
only $O(K)$ many options for how many different sizes we might need to skip.
Therefore, we can use the C preprocessor to "unroll" the parser and create
separate states for skipping $1$, $2$, $…$ hop fields.
This causes an $O(K)$ increase in FPGA area usage, but no latency increase --
our logic becomes wider, but not deeper.

The same tricks must then be applied in the ~packet_mod~ deparser.

The maximum path length $K$ that our BR can handle then becomes a linear
function of the NetFPGA's area (after subtracting the area we use for the rest
of the design): the largest $K$ we can use is determined by what we can fit.
Since our implementation uses the area quite efficiently (TODO number/reference)
and the NetFPGA is rather large, we are able to fit a $K = TODO$ on the NetFPGA
SUME.


[fn:varlen] The SCION host addresses are also variable-length, as the address
type tag in the common header defines what kind of address it is.
For this case, we opted to use the C preprocessor to conditionally replace the
union with a struct with three fixed-length fields (one for each possible type
of address), only one of which is parsed and made valid for a given packet.
(This causes a small increase in FPGA area usage, but any other solution would
be significantly more complex, so this is a good tradeoff.)

[fn:cantparse] In fact, it would be possible to parse the whole SCION packet by
using the C preprocessor to "unroll" the parser at compile time, and parse the
path segments into ~struct~'s with fields such as =hop1=, =hop2=, ... (size
fixed at compile time).
However, this would make actually using the fields very difficult, as I would
need more preprocessor magic to index into such a struct; and additionally it
would drastically increase my FPGA area usage.
