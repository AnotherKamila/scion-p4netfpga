This folder contains stuff that assembles the generated SCION module with some other modules to create the full design for the NetFPGA board.

Based on the upstream P4-NetFPGA project.

Changes:

- changed module name from SimpleSumeSwitch to Scion (to accomodate different architectures)
- switched to Non-Project Mode to avoid driving software people crazy
- changed some paths to make it work with my project structure
- split up project creation, synth, and bitfiles steps
- set the Makefile on fire and wrote a sane one
